## Hey, I'm Kelvin! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an incoming Software Development Engineer at Amazon. I graduated from the University of British Columbia, where I studied Electrical / Computer Engineering. I'm interested in distributed systems, security, and robotics. I also enjoy bouldering, figure skating, or volunteering with STEM outreach.
